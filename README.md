# Reaction Hero - Reaction Package

A Hero Carousel Package for Reaction Commerce.

Please note this is not at all ready for production, and is currently in development.

Clone to reaction/packages then add package to local meteor server:

	meteor add reaction-hero


# TODOs
* Figure out why the widget won't show up in the Dashboard App Store
* Update Hero Slides using the Admin
* Scale and fix Hero Slide images on upload
* Create a preview Bootstrap Carousel to display the Hero Slides
* Figure out how to inject the slideshow into a template
  * Use [UI.render](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/wiki/Using-Blaze#meteorrender-has-been-removed)
* Update the Admin UI (its pretty ugly)
